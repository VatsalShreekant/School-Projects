***ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS***
 Question 1:
     Which hash table collision resolution method did you use
     (eg. chaining or open addressing)? Explain your choice
     briefly (less than 25 words).
 YOUR ANSWER:Chaining. It works effectively with a load factor of more than 1. Whereas, tables with open addressing require load factor not to exceed 0.7. 

 
 
 
 
 Question 2:
       Which hash function (division or multiplication) did you use?
       How did you convert a string into a number?
 YOUR ANSWER:Division. I converted the string to a number by the means of concatenation. 

 
 
 
 Question 3:
       Another legal XML tag not used in this lab is the
       stand-alone tag.  This kind of tag
       combines both a start-tag and end-tag in one.
       It is identified with a '/' (slash) preceding the
       final >.  (For example, the <foo/>
       is a stand-alone tag that is self balancing.
       
       Describe briefly how
       you would modify Part 3 to allow this kind of tag.
       
 YOUR ANSWER:My part 3 wouldnt work hence I wouldn't know how to answer this question.
