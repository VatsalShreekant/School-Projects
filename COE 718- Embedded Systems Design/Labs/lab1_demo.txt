The physical joystick is hardwired into Port 1 to pins
20,23,24,25 and 26 as outlined in the documentation for the development board being used for
this course.

The FIODIR register controls GPIO as input or output.
As described in the lab manual
FIODIR must configure pins 20,23,24,25 and 26 as input pins from the Joystick by
setting each of these register values to zero using the code described in the lab manual.

* Joystick pins:
   - center: P1_20 = GPIO1[20]
   - up:     P1_23 = GPIO1[23]
   - down:   P1_25 = GPIO1[25]
   - left:   P1_26 = GPIO1[26]
   - right:  P1_24 = GPIO1[24] *
